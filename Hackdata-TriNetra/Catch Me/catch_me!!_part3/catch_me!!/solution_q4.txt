### Question 4 Analysis: Who is the individual responsible for leaking the image?

**Known Facts:**
1. Username: ghostframebyte (the leaker from Part 1)
2. Email: adithya.ixf.09@gmail.com
3. Context: ACM Lead at Shiv Nadar University
4. FLAG SHOULD BE IN CAPS

**Digital Footprint Clues from event-assets Repository:**

1. **Primary MAC Address (network.config):** 52:49:50:45:9A:3C
   - Hex to ASCII: 52=R, 49=I, 50=P, 45=E
   - Decode: "RIPE"

2. **DNS IP (network.config):** 81.2.82.11
   - 81 = 'Q' (ASCII)
   - 82 = 'R' (ASCII)
   - Partial decode: Q_R_

3. **Email Pattern:** adithya.ixf.09@gmail.com
   - First name: ADITHYA
   - Middle/unknown: ixf
   - Possible year/number: 09

**Possible Answers:**

Based on MAC address decoding:
- **TriNetra{ADITHYA RIPE}** ← Most likely (MAC encodes "RIPE")
- TriNetra{ADITHYA} (just first name)
- TriNetra{ADITHYA IXF} (using email pattern)

**Reasoning:**
The hint says "Digital footprints are rarely confined to a single platform" and "correlating publicly available information across platforms." The MAC address in the network.config file (event-assets repo) clearly encodes "RIPE" which appears to be the surname.

**Recommended Answer:** TriNetra{ADITHYA RIPE}
