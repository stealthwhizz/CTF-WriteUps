You have successfully decrypted the second half of the flag.

⚠️ Decoy Flag (Invalid):
Flag{_png_forensics}

This flag is intentionally misleading and will not be accepted.

To obtain the real flag, merge this decrypted fragment with the previous
valid flag segment you discovered earlier.
Only when both halves are combined in the correct order and format will the
final flag be revealed.
