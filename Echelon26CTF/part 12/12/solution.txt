Flag:
There really was no Arjun Rampal. He was used as a scapegoat. You are slowly breaking the Maya. flag{maya_unreveal}

Key observations:
- DNS TXT records leak flag fragments
- Session ID ties DNS and HTTP together
- TLS certificate expired in 2014
- Authentication occurs after expiry

Conclusion:
The identity was reused long after the person ceased to exist.
