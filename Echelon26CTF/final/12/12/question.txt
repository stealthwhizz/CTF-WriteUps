Authentication traffic references the username arjun.rampal and a repeated session identifier, a9f3c2e1, across multiple protocols.
DNS queries for arjun-rampal.internal return TXT records containing structured data tied to that same identifier.
Separately, certificate metadata in the capture shows a validity period ending on 2014-01-01.
All authentication activity using this identity occurs well after that date.
If the credentials are valid but the identity expired years earlier, then the name was never the actor.
